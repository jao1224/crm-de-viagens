## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082), a sophisticated and calming hue, is used to create a sense of trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA), nearly matching the primary color in hue, but with very low saturation to ensure it does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF) offers a modern and eye-catching highlight color. It complements the deep indigo without overshadowing it.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif, imparts a unique artistic quality. Body text: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif, to provide comfortable reading of more extensive text.
- Dashboard layout is designed to be modular, with clear divisions for different functionalities. Prioritize important metrics with larger, more prominent placement.
- Subtle transitions on data updates to provide users with instant feedback. Animated loading indicators to indicate longer load times. 
- Consistent usage of minimalist line icons throughout the interface, aligning with the theme's elegance and ensuring clarity.
